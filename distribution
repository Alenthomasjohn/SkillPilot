🛠️ Project Architecture Overview (Using n8n)
Core Flow:

User inputs profile data (skills, education, interests).

Agent queries job and course APIs.

Agent processes and ranks results.

User receives a summary (on-screen or via email/SMS).

Logs saved to SQLite or Firebase.

Agent learns/improves (basic retraining/feedback).

👥 Task Distribution (7 Members)
🧑‍💻 Member 1: Frontend & User Input UI
Build the simple UI using Streamlit or HTML + JS.

Form to collect: name, skills, education, interests.

Trigger webhook to n8n on submit.

Connect with n8n via HTTP node.

Optional: Add spinner/loading + summary UI.

🧑‍💻 Member 2: n8n Orchestration & Flow Designer
Set up main agent flow in n8n:

Webhook node for user input

Pass to LangChain/OpenAI node

Call job APIs

Call course APIs

Format result → send back to frontend

Handle error & fallback flows.

Optional: Add SMS/email node (e.g., Twilio, Gmail).

🧑‍💻 Member 3: Job API Integration
Integrate job APIs (e.g., Naukri, RapidAPI LinkedIn Jobs).

Design functions to fetch jobs based on:

User location, skills, interest

Format job result to clean JSON.

Add authentication if needed (API keys, headers).

🧑‍💻 Member 4: Course Recommendation Integration
Use platforms like Coursera, YouTube Data API, or Udemy.

Filter courses based on user skill gap.

Clean & rank results using relevance.

Send to the main n8n flow.

🧑‍💻 Member 5: AI Agent (LangChain/OpenAI)
Create a LangChain agent (Python) to:

Analyze user input.

Summarize job & course data.

Generate actionable recommendations.

Integrate with n8n using Execute Command or Webhook.

🧑‍💻 Member 6: Database & Logging
Set up SQLite or Firebase.

Design schema: user_id, inputs, timestamp, job list, course list, agent summary.

Add insert/update nodes in n8n.

Optionally: fetch past records for personalized recs.

🧑‍💻 Member 7: Email/SMS Integration + Testing
Integrate Twilio (SMS) or Gmail API (email).

Format and send summaries using n8n.

Add buttons: “Email me this” / “Send to WhatsApp”.

Do final E2E testing and bug fixing.
